# Hey there! 👋

I'm **Kunal**, a developer and engineering student based in India.

I design and build immersive web experiences and bring physical objects to life with code.

If an idea pops into my head—whether it's a sci-fi website or a hardware sensor—I'll build it and deploy it.

My main tech stack is **React, TypeScript, C++, and Python**. My favorite tools are **Photoshop, Premiere Pro, After Effects, Google AI Studio, Firebase and Antigravity**.

I've got a bunch of interesting projects, but my absolute favorite is the [Techfest 2025 FBVA](https://github.com/lotus-outlook-6/Techfest-2025-FBVA).

I don't like procrastination. I prefer to "vibe code" until the job is done.
